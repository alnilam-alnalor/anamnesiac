      _For Summer, Sophia decided to try out being a healer, while not actually giving up much in the way of her damage. She has a
      significantly higher INT stat than any other healer in the game and is an orb wielder on top, meaning she doesn't have to
      deal with the laggy staff animations that almost every other healer currently does. Her fast casts and spells mean she isn't
      that bad for wracking up hit count helping her rush gain._
      
      
      Her most powerful utility aspect however is her ability to be an
      AP battery, where casting certain offensive spells will grant AP to the other party members. This means she's good in just
      about any composition, though her post INT rush means she really shines with invokers. If SSophia has any weaknesses it would
      be that her actual heal is not the most potent in a pinch and may require a cancel bonus before hand._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Offensive spells restore AP to the party
      
      - Post rush buff that's powerful for self and other INT characters.
      
      - High damage. Especially for a healer.
      
      - Orb wielder, makes her less clunky and laggy compared to her staff counter parts.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Weak standalone heal. Highly depending on weaving it into her rotation for effectiveness.
      
      - This means the AI will suck with her. Hard.
      
      - Lightning Wave has a max range which can make it awkward to use.
      
      - Below average rush build.
      
      
      **Rotation**
      
      *Normal > Lightning Strike > Lightning Wave > Lightning Strike > Spam it till out of AP. (General combo. Requires 2-3 AP seed.)*
      
      *Normal > Lightning Strike > Faerie Light Wave > Lightning Strike > Spam it till out of AP. (No AP seed.)
      
      *Thunder Flare is a workable replacement for Lightning Wave and helps her rush build, but beware its higher AP cost.

      _The games starter pick for healers and a pretty terrible healer to boot, is also the worst of your five healing options. But
      if you just picked her, don't fret too much! You can re-roll! But in seriousness she is usable if weak. She's a 5 star
      non-ace which is important to keep in mind. She has less stats but is easier to max limit break. One of Miki's biggest
      issues is her lack of party buffs in her talents. In fact she's the only 5 star healer in the game who doesn't provide something
      to the party. Even the freebie 5 star of Oracle Nel does. Her party wide heal also has a massive AP cost which makes her
      awkward to use._
      
      
      _Miki does have her strong points however. Her post rush buff is a very powerful party wide regen. Her grit talent
      to survive lethal damage also makes her quite hard to kill, which is useful in a healer especially for solo content. In summary, 
      Miki is pretty weak, but she has some strong points._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - 5 star non-ace so is cheaper to max limit break and augment
      
      - Powerful post rush health regen buff for the party.
      
      - Grit talent makes her hard to kill. Making her viable for solo content
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - 5 star non-ace so has less stats
      
      - No talents that contribute to the party
      
      - Poor damage
      
      - Expensive healing

      _The games first ace healer, also a rare sighting of an earth caster. Millie a healer with the ability to support dps due to her
      talents and post rush buff. Making her a significant improvement over Miki. However like most of our current healers, her damage
      is still quite low, in fact it's so bad it's best to just focus on using a normal and heal rather than actually casting 
      any damage spells, plus there are a lot of post rush elemental buffs that will over ride her talent buff in the game now as well.
      On top of that even with her AP cost reduction, her heal is still very expensive, but all her other options are bad so your 
      really taking her as a healing buff stick. In summary, Millie is a good buffer, but she is just a healing buffer so she will be
      very boring to play._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Strong elemental damage buff for the party
      
      - Post rush buff that boosts critical rate and heals most of the party's HP
      
      - Talent that helps surviability
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Damage spells take a long time to cast making them bad
      
      - Common access to elemental damage buffs post rush that override her talent
      
      - Boring to play optimally
      
      - Expensive healing

      _Rena is a unique healer in the fact she uses Knuckles rather than the traditional caster type weapons such as staffs and orbs.
      She also has the powerful party combat buff in Angel Feather that boosts all stats by 20%. Her cast times are also extremely 
      fast and her talents suit a melee composition very well. On top of that a 90% grit chance is insanely high, especially 
      considering her fast casting meaning she's pretty hard to kill._
      
      
      _She does have her downsides, you can only run one of her two damage spells and they're interchangable with
      lancer providing more damage, but lasers lets you complete rotations with faerie light faster. She has pretty slow rush gain
      especially if she's struggling to hit with her damage spells, and her melee normals make playing her a little awkward. In
      summary Rena is the best true healer we have right now, fast cast times, a strong buff, good healing output. But her low damage
      and slow rush gain leave something to be desire._   
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Fast cast times
      
      - Talents and post rush buff that is amazing for melee compositions
      
      - Hard to kill
      
      - Angel Feather stacks with all party passive buffs.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Low damage
      
      - Slow rush gain, unless you put yourself in danger by meleeing the boss
      
      - Melee range normals
      
      - Offers little to ranged characters
      
      - Radiant Lancer's damage and rush gain are backloaded onto the final hit, which sucks for especially mobile bosses

      _Oracle Nel is a free welfare 5 star unit. She just manages to edge out Miki as the worst 5 star healer in the game, but Tearful
      Welch came along to take her title as worst free unit. Oracle Nel is still usable and isn't a pure grief character. She offers
      a weak damage buff to the party, her repel talent helps her avoid taking aggro and her movement boost also helps her stay out of
      trouble. She's also an ice caster which is rare and her rush doesn't deal terrible damage. Ice Needles is also a decent filler
      spell which has homing so it'll actually hit the target helping rush gain._
      
      _Her down sides, however are many. No AP or cast time
      reduction means her healing is expensive and slow. Her post rush buff is not party wide and while it improves her damage you
      aren't bringing a healer for their personal dps. Her stats are also quite weak, having very low INT due to the lack of a self
      INT buff. In summary, she makes for a character that needs to be carried, will be nice to have her if you fancy a welfare
      character run in harder content as the designated healer._

      - Lack of self INT buff
      
      - Lack of party wide rush buff
      
      - No cast time reduction gives long casts

      _Evelysse isn't some useless poster girl who looks good and orders you around. She decides to get stuck in. She also happens to
      be the first character that has had buffs compared to their JP version counterpart. The reduction of cast times by 20% and the
      20% reduction to her rush gauge or global exclusive buffs. These buffs however aren't enough to make Eve outstanding and they
      still err on the side of caution with Evelysse._
      
      
      _Her unique post rush ability to revive the party is very powerful, but the lack
      of ability to get to use it, and the fact that as a healer you should be trying to prevent deaths, don't really do much to make
      Eve a must pick. She also has long cast times even with the reduction so you have to pick your spells. Lancer is the best filler
      spell she has, but an enemy that likes moving makes conjure comet's ability to home very useful. In all Evelysse is usable but not incredible, she brings some party buffs 
      that are on the weak side but not common in overlap currently. If you want to use her though, by all means do, just know it
      might be challenging in harder content._
      
      
      **TL DR**

      **Cons**

      - Lack of powerful buffs for the party

      _Sarah enters the game as the latest non-ace 5 star that you can pull. The benefit to her is that this makes her one of the
      better 5 stars to pull and invest in. Sarah is a budget Rena who supports a long range team over a melee composition, on top of
      that she gains the powerful Angel Feather buff just like Rena and a grit talent with a high trigger chance, just like Rena.
      Extra benefits she brings is that she grans immunity to and cleanses poison and paralysis, making her a great pick if you're
      just looking for a healer for Maze of Tribulations, plus means you don't need to use 4 star characters and invest in them.
      However while she shares many positives with our best permanent ace healer, right now, she has many more negatives._ 
      
      
      _She lacks both AP cost reduction and faster cast times, couple that with being a staff user it means her
      spells are both expensive and slow, especially her party healing. She also lacks a self INT buff, giving her the lowest INT out
      of any of the permanent healers, the only healer with less is the freebie Oracle Nel. Her lack of AP reduction means Angel Feather
      in particular is very expensive to use which slows her rush gain right down, meaning that 3 person rushes will be common with 
      a Sarah in your group. In summary Sarah is a significant improvement on Miki, and worth considering if you want a healer for
      your Maze team, but if you're looking to play a healer in M2 or M3 content it may be best to look elsewhere._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - 5 star non-ace so is cheaper to max limit break and augment
      
      - Immunity to Poison and Paralysis.
      
      - Her rush is an excellent clutch heal and includes party cleanse.
      
      - Grit talent makes her hard to kill.
      
      - Angel Feather stacks with all party passive buffs.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - 5 star non-ace so has less stats
      
      - Slow cast times, staff casting animation and ridiculous AP costs makes clutch healing very difficult.
      
      - Angel Feather actively interferes with her reliability due to its lengthy cast time & AP cost.
      
      - Slow rush gain
      
      - Poor damage
      
      
      **Rotation**

      _Precis decides that before showing up as a permanent character, she'll join to add some Christmas cheer to your party. Winter
      Precis is very comparable to Summer Sophia as both are AP batteries who provide AP to the party when they cast an offensive 
      spell. Precis also provides mobility buffs to the party, only overlapping with 9S currently. Her symbology reduction time is also
      party wide making her a good option for invoker comps as her cast time reduction is better than many characters self cast time 
      reduction buffs. Her best attributes lie in her hit counter buffs, which buff both critical hit rate and critical hit damage, 
      which also helps make her the best character to bring to Crystal Guadian if everyone wants to auto._
      
      
      _On top of all that she also extends the hit count timer by two seconds which means she really helps bring hit count compositions
      together. This means she has fantastic synergy with both the winter and halloween characters. Her post rush buff also keeps that 
      critical hit rate where it was even after losing your hit counter and she provides a regen health buff, allowing her to focus on 
      damage post rush as regen provides the sustain._
      
      
      _She still has her weaknesses, being a staff wielder being one of them as the animations are still
      an issue. Also she has no homing attack and because Lancer which has most of its damage on the last hit, and rays has most of
      its damage on the initial hit, meaning that bosses that like to move a lot such as Jie can provide a real problem for her damage
      output. In summary Winter Precis is one of the best healers you can run with right now, she works with any composition but really
      shines with her fellow hit count lovers._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**


      - Strong buffing, inc. movement buffs, hit count buffs and an excellent post-rush buff.
      
      - Grants AP to the party when using offensive spells.
      
      - Great invoking time reduction for the party.
           
      - Hit count timer extension gives good synergy with hit count characters.


      **Cons**

      - Staff animations
      
      - High animation lock; struggles against fast moving targets.
      
      - Sacred Lancer's damage and rush gain are backloaded onto the final hit, adding insult to injury.
      
      - Lack of AP reduction talent
      
      - Lack of talent to help surviability
      
      
      **Rotation**
      
      *Normal > Rays > Lancer > Rays (Damage Rotation)*

      _Relia joins the fray and shows us how merciless the Captain and Eve are in sending a small child into battle. Relia is a healer
      designed largely to be played by AI, for AI. Her ATK buff is attached to her heal which ensures she doesn't get caught up
      in a choice between buffing and healing. She nullifies problematic fields for AI melee. Her HP regeneration helps mitigate against
      the many hits they will inevitably take and the AP recovery allows AI to deal more damage, more often. This makes her a very
      powerful healer for Maze of Tribulations and with the right comps and play, she can enable a single player party to survive M2
      content or even some M3s. As few healers can fill this role as effectively, this gives her incredible longevity too._
      
      
      _Unfortunately, many of these issues she addresses are not often shared by players. That, alongside her lackluster damage, hampers
      her compared to the likes of Summer Sophia, Rena and Winter Precis. She is also a staff caster and comes with all of the related
      downsides, inc. slow casting animations, high AP costs and clunky gameplay. Her other major achilles heel is her squshiiness, 
      which almost necessitates a Dreaming Bear for its +20% HP buff. Finally, her Brute Enlightenment buff is better on paper than in
      practice, and trying to maintain both is a fool's errand that results in her rush gain falling behind._
      
      
      _She's a great pull if you enjoy the fantasy of playing a full-time classical RPG healer, or if you're building a single player
      party and intend to tackle M2 content or higher with it._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
     
      **Pros**
      
      - Both Faerie Light and Brute Englightenment (INT only) buffs stack with all passive party buffs, which is impressive utility.
      
      - Faerie Light having a Growth buff baked in makes it so much easier to maintain.
      
      - Talents that cover many of the AI's worst flaws in single player parties.
      
      - One of the most future proof characters in her niche.
      
      - Great invoking time reduction.
      
      - Rare single target DMG buff on her rush.
      
      
      **Cons**      
      
      - Staff animations and high AP costs.
      
      - Abysmal damage, among the worst in the game.
      
      - Attempting to maintain both Brute Enlightenment and Faerie Light really screws her rush gain.
      
      - Brute Enlightenment is a dead spell in most comps, and horrible in AI hands. Unequip it immediately for single player.
      
      - Low natural surviability.


      **Rotation**   
     
      - Enraging Faerie Light (Healing)
      
      - Normal > Enraging Faerie Light > Radiant Lancer/Aurora Rings ("Damage" rotation, best for rush gain)

      - Brute Enlightenment (Re-apply when necessary)*

  notes: >
      _Fina is our first truly imbue-able healer (as in, battle skills). This is huge, as bows go on to cover a wide-range of elements
      over the game's lifetime. This enables Fina to slot-in to any party on any boss and be able to contribute weakness stun 
      (assuming a bow exists). She also eases herself in on other healer niches, with her Cheer buff and AP feeding._
      
      
      _While she isn't the best AP battery, her Cheer being upgraded from boostin ATK/INT/DEF by 20% to 25%, competes strongly with
      Angel feather, which boosts all stats by 20%, due to GRD in particular being a weak stat and the extra 5% makes up for the loss 
      of HIT buffing. being able to bring both weak AP feeding with a powerful stat buff is very strong and makes up for her lack of 
      party talent buffs. With the 70% cast time reduction buff, her ability to clutch heal is pretty good now._
      
      
      _The catch, unfortunately, is that she is using bow; this makes her perform poorly under AI control, which makes her less than
      ideal for single player. That said, great healer. Who may well be the current best healer we have, though it is a close contest._
      
      **TL DR**


      **Pros**

      - Cheer is a very powerful buffing skill
      
      - Grants AP to the party when using offensive skills
      
      - Great personal invoking time reduction.
           
      - Not elemental locked, can wield imbue weapons


      **Cons**

      - Has Bow AI
      
      - Not a great AP battery compared to other healers
      
      - Lack of AP reduction talent
      
      - Lack of talent to help surviability


      **Rotation**
      
      *Normal > Aim > Spam till out of AP (AP feeding & Rush gain rotation)*
      
      *Normal > Aim > Curaga (Feed/Healing rotation)*
      
      *Normal > Aim > Curaga > Aim (Feed/Healing rotation with -10% AP reduction or -5% AP and 104-105 AP)*
      
      *Cheer (Buff when necessary)*

  notes: >
      _Welch gets her first Ace version and is actually pretty good. She is also the first tome user of GL which is a plus as tome
      casting is a far bigger improvement on staff casting. Welch has quite a few things going for her on her release. For starters
      her INT & ATK damage buffs are still quite rare and 25% is a high number for the buff currently and 10% without a condition is
      good. Her debuff of making enemies take 30% more damage when they drop below 50% HP is pretty strong. She also deals pretty
      good damage by healer standards, similar to SSophia in feeling like an invoker with the ability to heal, this is due to her
      reasonably high INT stat and high multipliers of 2 of the three damage skills she has. Her Hp buff also adds some personal 
      bulk and her spells can't be interupted allowing her to get out emergency healing. Her post rush debuff is meh, reducing DEF
      isn't the best but it's good if you lack a source of crit buffing._
      
      
      _Valentine Welch does have her downsides. For a start, being Earth locked is a pretty big draw back as Earth is not a popular
      weakness for bosses. She also won't age well as once INT and ATK damage buffs become more common place her best quality 
      becomes her damage taken debuff. Also compared to the other healers she's a bit lacking, while her debuffs and damage are nice
      she doesn't bring an Angel Feather like buff to the table, nor does she AP feed, meaning she's basically a hard hitting 
      healer with a bad element to be locked into._
      
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
     
      **Pros**
      
      - Built in AP reduction and self INT and HP buffs.
      
      - Deals good damage compared to other healers.
      
      - Decent buffs that boost ATK & INT damage.
      
      - Super armor while casting.
      
      - Tome Caster
      
      - Strong de-buffs
      
      
      **Cons**      
      
      - Earth locked.
      
      - Lacks traits to help surviability beyond a HP buff.
      
      - Her good buffs won't age well.
      
      - Doesn't bring any combat buffs or AP feeding unlike other top healers.

  notes: >
      _Evelysse gets to be the first awakened healer and she's still kind of meh. She is a significant improvement over her old self
      this is due to to faster rush and shorter cast times. Her healing is now 10AP less as well meaning she can weave it more
      easily and use it sooner. She also can't have her casts interupted meaning emergency heals go off more and she's had some bulk 
      added. Her attacks and rush have also recieved damage boosts and she wasn't the weakest of healers especially post rush to begin
      with._
      
      _The main problem with awakened Eve is, she's better but still has the same problems. Her rush gain is slow, she has no guts to
      survive clutch heal moments, her casting is still slow and the added build isn't really that big of a deal. Her lack of a fifth
      skill is odd and really an extra skill could have gone a long way in giving Eve more utility but she still will continue to
      have to pay for her ability to res._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Can revive party members by rushing
      
      - Powerful post rush self buff that gives insane healing and damage
      
      - Consistent damage
      
      - Buffs INT and rush damage
      
      - Hard hitting rush compared to most healers
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Poor rush gain
      
      - Lack of powerful buffs for the party
      
      - Lack of a good talent that helps survivability
